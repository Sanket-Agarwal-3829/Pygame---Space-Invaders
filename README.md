Space Invaders
This Space Invaders game was one of the first projects I built when I started learning Python during my second year. While exploring the basics of Python programming, I created this game to solidify my understanding of concepts like loops, functions, and object-oriented programming. It also introduced me to using libraries like Pygame for interactive applications.

Shooting: Fire bullets to destroy incoming enemies.
Enemy Movement: Enemies descend from the top of the screen, moving in a zigzag pattern.
